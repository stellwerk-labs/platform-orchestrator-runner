# Manual Release Candidates

The normal stable tag release remains available for non-RC `vX.Y.Z` tags in the
original `stellwerk-labs/platform-orchestrator-runner` repository. Release
candidates use a separate manual path, so pushing `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` does not publish
public artifacts by itself.

## Before Dispatch

- Transfer this workflow/helper/docs change separately through an approved
  workflow-only source change.
- Obtain explicit approval for the source revision, root candidate tag, release
  notes and public GHCR image destination.
- Create the approved `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` tag separately at the reviewed 40-character
  commit SHA. The workflow never creates or moves tags.
- Add reviewed notes at `docs/releases/<candidate-tag>.md` in the tagged source.
- Configure the existing `public-release-candidate` environment with required
  reviewers before dispatch.
- Set `CORE_CP_INTEGRATION_IMAGE`, `CORE_IAM_INTEGRATION_IMAGE` and
  `CORE_DP_INTEGRATION_IMAGE` to the compatible public candidate image digests
  recorded in the OSS release manifest.

## Dispatch and Recovery

Dispatch the Build and push workflow with `candidate_tag` and `candidate_sha`.
Unit, artifact, integration and chart validation gates run against the supplied
SHA before the protected publication job can start. The protected job revalidates
the SHA/tag/reviewer contract, refuses any existing draft or published GitHub
release for the tag, refuses any existing image tag, reserves a GitHub prerelease
with `--latest=false`, and then publishes only the exact RC image tag.

If a failure happens after release reservation, the RC identifier is consumed.
Inspect the failed run and prepare a newly approved `rc.N+1`; do not overwrite
the image, delete evidence, rerun against a moved tag or promote it as stable.
